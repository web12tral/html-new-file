<h1>Chola Dynasty</h1>
<center><p>
	The Chola Dynasty was a Tamil thalassocratic empire of southern India and one of the longest-ruling 
dynasties in world history. The earliest datable references to the Chola are from inscriptions
 dated to the 3rd century BCE during the reign of Ashoka of the Maurya Empire. 
 As one of the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam, along with the Chera and Pandya,
  the dynasty continued to govern over varying territories until the 13th century CE.
   Despite these ancient origins, the rise of the Chola, as the "Chola Empire," only 
   begins with the medieval Cholas in the mid-9th century CE.
   <br><br>
The heartland of the Cholas was the fertile valley of the Kaveri River. 
Still, they ruled a significantly larger area at the height of their power
 from the later half of the 9th century till the beginning of the 13th century. 
 They unified peninsular India, south of the Tungabhadra, and held as one state for
  three centuries between 907 and 1215 AD.Under Rajaraja I and his successors Rajendra I, 
  Rajadhiraja I, Rajendra II, Virarajendra, and Kulothunga Chola I, the dynasty became a
   military, economic and cultural powerhouse in South Asia and South-East Asia.
    The power and the prestige the Cholas had amoung political powers in South, 
	South-eastern, and eastern Asia at its peak is evident through their 
	expeditions to the Ganges, naval raids on cities of the Srivijaya 
	empire based on the island of Sumatra, and their repeated embassies to China.
	 The Chola fleet represented the zenith of ancient Indian maritime capacity.
	 <br><br>
During the period of 1010–1153 CE, the Chola territories stretched from the Maldives 
in the south to the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh as the northern limit.
 Rajaraja Chola conquered peninsular South India, annexed part of the Rajarata kingdom in 
 present-day Sri Lanka, and occupied Maldives islands. His son Rajendra Chola further 
 expanded the Cholar territory by sending a victorious expedition to North India that 
 touched the river Ganges and defeating the Pala ruler of Pataliputra, Mahipala. 
 By 1019, he also completely conquered the Rajarata kingdom of Sri Lanka and annexed it to 
 the Chola empire. In 1025, Rajendra Chola also successfully invaded the cities of 
 Srivijaya empire, based on the island of Sumatra. However, this invasion failed 
 to install direct administration over Srivijaya, as the invasion was short and only
  meant to plunder the wealth of Srivijaya. However, the Chola influence on Srivijava 
  would last until 1070, when the Cholas began to lose almost all of their overseas 
  territories. The later Cholas (1070–1279) would still rule portions of Southern India. 
  The Chola dynasty went into decline at the beginning of the 13th century with the rise 
  of the Pandyan dynasty, which ultimately caused their downfall.
  <br><br>
The Cholas succeeded in building the greatest thalassocratic empire in the history of India, 
thereby leaving a lasting legacy. They established a centralized form of government and a 
disciplined bureaucracy. Moreover, their patronage of Tamil literature and their zeal for
 building temples has resulted in some of the greatest works of Tamil literature and architecture.
  The Chola kings were avid builders and envisioned the temples in their kingdoms not only as 
  places of worship but also as centers of economic activity.A UNESCO world heritage 
  site, the Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur, commissioned by the Rajaraja Chola in 1010 CE, 
  is a prime example for Cholar architecture. They were also well known for their patronage to 
  art. The development of the specific sculpturing technique used in the 'Chola bronzes', 
  exquisite bronze sculptures of Hindu deities built in a lost wax process was pioneered in 
  their time. The Chola tradition of art spread and influenced the architecture and art of Southeast Asia.

The Chola military was the combined armed forces of the Chola Empire organized during two separate 
Tamil golden ages, the Sangam Period and the Medieval Era. The Chola military fought dozens of wars,<br>
 it also underwent numerous changes in structure, organization, equipment and tactics, while conserving
 a core of lasting Tamil traditions.<br><br>

 Karikala Chola stands pre-eminent amongst all those mentioned in Pattinappaalai. 'Karikala' means
  'elephant feller' or 'charred leg', which is assumed to be a reference to an accident by fire that 
  befell the prince early in his life. Pattinappaalai describes this accident and the enterprising way
   in which the prince escaped and established himself on the Chola throne. Pattinappalai is a poem on 
   the then Chola capital Kaveripattinam and describes the numerous battles Karikala fought against the
    Cheras and Pandyas, including the famous Battle of Venni where the Chola army defeated a confederacy
	 of (about) a dozen rulers headed by Chera and Pandya kings. Following the battle, the Chera king was
	  disgraced (received a wound on his back) and committed suicide. Karikala thus broke the confederacy
	   that was formed against him, conquered the Chera and Pandya kingdoms, and established Chola hegemony 
	   over Tamilakam. After the Battle of Venni, Karikala defeated the confederacy of nine minor chieftains 
	   in the Battle of Vakaipparandalai. He also invaded Sri Lanka and took away, among other things, 12,000 
	   Sinhalese men to work as slaves in the construction of the Kallanai Dam.
